## My process
- First I started to investigate the index.html file. It only contained a div with the necessary texts. Therefore some divs needed to be added. I added the card and divided the text in a heading and a paragraph.
- After completing the elements, I started working on the styling. Since both desktop and mobile designs are really similar to each other, I decided to use flex-boxs to center the card both vertically and horizontally. The I styled the components within the card. Important to note is that the card had a slightly higher border-radius than the image within the card. Adding some padding and font-weight to the items within the card was the last job I did for this challenge.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I did not learn much, since most I already had knowledge of all components to complete this challenge.

Beginners will learn about flex-box and how to center align a div both horizontally as vertically.
